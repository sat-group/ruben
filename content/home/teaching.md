* Spring 2021 - [15-414/614 Bug Catching: Automated Program Verification
](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/) with Frank Pfenning. This course teaches students how to write bug-free code through the process of software verification, which aims to prove the correctness of a program with respect to a mathematical specification

* Fall 2020 - [15-816 Advanced Topics in Logic: Automated Reasoning and Satisfiability](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/15816-f20/) with Marijn Heule. This course teaches
students about automated reasoning techniques and their applications from the
verification of hardware and software to solve open problems in mathematics.

* Fall 2019 - [15-816 Advanced Topics in Logic: Automated Reasoning and Satisfiability](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/15816-f19/) with Marijn Heule. This course teaches
students about automated reasoning techniques and their applications from the
verification of hardware and software to solve open problems in mathematics.

* Fall 2018 - [15-414/614 Bug Catching: Automated Program Verification
](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/f18/) with Matt Fredrikson. This course teaches students how to write bug-free code through the process of software verification, which aims to prove the correctness of a program with respect to a mathematical specification
