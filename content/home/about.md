# Biography

Ruben Martins is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin,
USA. Prior to joining UT Austin, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the
University of Oxford, UK, and he received his PhD with honors from the 
University of Lisbon, Portugal in 2013. His research aims to improve constraint
solvers and broaden their applicability in program analysis, synthesis, and
security. Dr. Martins has developed several award winning solvers and has
consistently improved the state-of-the-art in Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT)
solving. He is currently the main developer of Open-WBO: an open source MaxSAT
solver that won several awards in the MaxSAT competitions.
