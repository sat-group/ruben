# Biography

Ruben Martins is a Systems Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. His interests lie in the intersection of constraint programming with program synthesis, analysis, and verification. His recent research focuses on using programming synthesis to automate data science related tasks such as data querying, imputation, consolidation, and tidying. Ruben received his PhD with honors from the Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal (2013). He was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oxford, UK (2014-2015) and a postdoctoral researcher at UT Austin (2015-2017). He has developed several award winning constraint solvers and is the main developer of Open-WBO: an open source Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) solver that won several gold medals in MaxSAT competitions.
