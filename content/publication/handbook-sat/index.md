abstract: "Maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an optimization version of SAT that is solved by finding an optimal truth assignment instead of just a satisfying one. In MaxSAT the objective function to be optimized is specified by a set of weighted soft clauses: the objective value of a truth assignment is the sum of the weights of the soft clauses it satisfies. In addition, the MaxSAT problem can have hard clauses that the truth assignment must satisfy. Many optimization problems can be naturally encoded into MaxSAT and this, along with significant performance improvements in MaxSAT solvers, has led to MaxSAT being used in a number of different application areas. This chapter provides a detailed overview of the approaches to MaxSAT solving that have in recent years been most successful in solving real-world optimization problems. Further recent developments in MaxSAT research are also overviewed, including encodings, applications, preprocessing, incomplete solving, algorithm portfolios, partitioning-based solving, and parallel solving.
