abstract: "Nowadays, many data analysts are domain experts, but they
lack programming skills. As a result, many of them can
provide examples of data transformations but are unable to
produce the desired query. Hence, there is an increasing
need for systems capable of solving the problem of Query
Reverse Engineering (QRE). Given a database and output
table, these systems have to find the query that generated
this table. We present SQUARES, a program synthesis tool
based on input-output examples that can help data analysts
to extract and transform data by synthesizing SQL queries,
and table manipulation programs using the R language."
