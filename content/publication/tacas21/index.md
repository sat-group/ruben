abstract: "Form validators based on regular expressions are often used
on digital forms to prevent users from inserting data in the wrong format.
However, writing these validators can pose a challenge to some users.
We present Forest, a regular expression synthesizer for digital form
validations. Forest produces a regular expression that matches the desired
pattern for the input values and a set of conditions over capturing
groups that ensure the validity of integer values in the input. Our synthesis
procedure is based on enumerative search and uses a Satisfiability
Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to explore and prune the search space.We
propose a novel representation for regular expressions synthesis, multitree,
which induces patterns in the examples and uses them to split the
problem through a divide-and-conquer approach. We also present a new
SMT encoding to synthesize capture conditions for a given regular expression.
To increase confidence in the synthesized regular expression,
we implement user interaction based on distinguishing inputs.
We evaluated Forest on real-world form-validation instances using regular
expressions. Experimental results show that Forest successfully
returns the desired regular expression in 70% of the instances and outperforms
Regel, a state-of-the-art regular expression synthesizer."
