abstract: "Satisfiability (SAT) solving has become an important technology in computer-aided
mathematics with various successes in number and graph theory. In this paper we apply
SAT solvers to color infinitely long strips in the plane with a given height and number of
colors. The coloring is constrained as follows: two points that are exactly unit distance
apart must be colored differently. To finitize the problem, we tile the strips and all points
on a tile have the same color. We evaluated our approach using two different tile shapes:
squares and hexagons. The visualization of bounded height strips using 3 to 6 colors reveal
patterns that are similar to the best known lower bounds for infinite strips. Our method
can be a useful tool for mathematicians to search for patterns that can be generalized to
infinite strips and allowed us to increase the lower bound for the strip height with 5 colors
to an improved height of 1.700084."
