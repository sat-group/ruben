abstract: "Congestion Control Algorithms (CCAs) impact numerous desirable Internet properties such as performance, stability, and
fairness. Hence, the networking community invests substantial effort into studying whether new algorithms are safe for
wide-scale deployment. However, operators today are continuously innovating and some deployed CCAs are unpublished
– either because the CCA is in beta or because it is considered
proprietary. How can the networking community evaluate
these new CCAs when their inner workings are unknown?
In this paper, we propose ‘counterfeit congestion control
algorithms’ – reverse-engineered implementations derived
using program synthesis based on observations of the
original implementation. Using the counterfeit (synthesized)
CCA implementation, researchers can then evaluate the CCA
using controlled empirical testbeds or mathematical analysis,
even without access to the original implementation. Our
initial prototype, ‘Mister 880,’ can synthesize several basic
CCAs including a simplified Reno using only a few traces."
